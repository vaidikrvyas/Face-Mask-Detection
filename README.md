# Face Mask Detection

## Introduction
This project is designed to detect whether individuals in a video stream are wearing face masks or not. It uses machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze live video feeds and identify the presence of face masks on people's faces.

## Features
- Real-time face mask detection
- High accuracy and performance
- Supports multiple camera inputs
- Alerts and notifications for non-compliance

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Other necessary libraries and frameworks

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main script to start the detection:
   ```
   python face_mask_detector.py
   ```

## Usage
After launching the application, point the camera towards the area where you want to detect face masks. The system will automatically detect faces and indicate whether a mask is present or not.
